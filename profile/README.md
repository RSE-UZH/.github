# Welcome to the Remote Sensing of Environmental Changes (RSE) GitHub Page üåç  

The **Remote Sensing of Environmental Changes (RSE)** group focuses on developing innovative open-source tools and methods to monitor and analyze environmental changes. By combining multi-sensor satellite data with airborne observations‚Äîsuch as historical images and data from upcoming Earth observation missions‚Äîwe aim to understand the spatiotemporal impacts of climate change on the cryosphere, forestry, and geomorphology.  
We aim to observe and understand related processes by combining multi-sensor satellite data with airborne observations, including historical images and upcoming earth observation missions.

## üî¨ Areas of Research  
- **Cryosphere:** Monitoring glaciers, snow, and ice dynamics to assess climate change impacts.  
- **Forestry:** Quantifying changes in vegetation patterns and forest health.  
- **Geomorphology:** Understanding landscape evolution and geomorphic processes through remote sensing.
